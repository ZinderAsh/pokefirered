# Unfair Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen

This is and edited version of the [**disassembly of Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen**](https://github.com/pret/pokefirered), changed to make the RNG aspects of combat always be in the opponent's favor. Have fun in this hellscape.

All of these aspects are changed to be in the opponent's favor:
- Accuracy Checks (player will only hit with 100% accuracy, opp always hits)
- Critical Hit Checks (player never crits, opp always crits)
- Damage Rolls (max rolls for opp, min rolls for player)
- Sleep turns (2 turns for opp, 5 for player)
- Confusion turns (2 turns for opp, 5 for player)
- Confusion hit-rate (player is always hit, opponent is never)
- Wrap turns (2 turns for opp, 5 for player)
- Side Effect Chances
- Protect multiple turns
- Multi-hit moves (always 5 for opp, 2 for player)
- OHKO moves (always hit for opp if they are higher lvl, never for player)
- Psywave damage (lvl x 1.5 for opp, lvl x 0.5 for player)
- Turns for Encore, Disable (always 2 for opp, 5 for player)
- Spite PP reduction (2 on opp, 5 on player)
- Present (always heals opp, 120 power on player)
- Magnitude (always 150 power for opp, 10 power for player)
- Catch Rate (you basically can't catch anything)
- Player will always lose a speed tie
- Freeze (player is frozen forever, opponent thaws immediately)
- Paralysis (player is never able to move, opponent can always move)
- Shed Skin
- Effect Spore, Poison Point, Static, Flame Body
- King's Rock
- Traded Pokemon will always disobey when at a high level
- You can't get random items from Pickup

These RNG aspects are unchanged:
- No increased wild encounters
- You can run away
- You can still catch fish
- Turns for Thrash, Outrage, Petal Dance, Uproar

Other changes:
- You can run anywhere, also before getting the shoes
